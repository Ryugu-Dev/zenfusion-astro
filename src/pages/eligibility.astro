    <p>Eligibility verification is a critical component of the Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) process. At ZenFusion, we
        offer reliable and efficient Eligibility Services to help healthcare providers avoid claim denials, ensuring
        smooth reimbursement cycles and streamlined operations.</p>
    <div class="space32"></div>
    <h3>The Importance of Eligibility Verification</h3>
    <div class="space24"></div>
    <p>Insurance verification is one of the most crucial steps in the RCM cycle. Errors or oversights in determining
        coverage details, such as Coordination of Benefits (COB), can lead to claim denials and delayed reimbursements.
        ZenFusion’s services focus on avoiding these issues upfront, ensuring payments are processed accurately and on
        time within the 30 to 60-day cycle.</p>
    <div class="space32"></div>
    <h3>Comprehensive Verification Process</h3>
    <div class="space24"></div>
    <p>Our dedicated team leverages advanced, internally developed applications to efficiently verify patient
        eligibility. When needed, physical calls are made to insurance providers to confirm details and resolve
        potential discrepancies, minimizing the risk of rejections or denials. This meticulous approach ensures that
        healthcare providers can focus on patient care without administrative setbacks.
